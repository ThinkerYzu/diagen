# Diagen is a diagram genrators for a software system

Diagen defines a symbol syntax easy for describing the behavior and
architecture of a software system.  It is optimized for notes of what
is found during tracing code.  A programmer who is tracing a system
just put down important lines to describe calls/uses/owns between
module/class/functions.  Diagen will generate a diagram in dot to
describe behaviors.
